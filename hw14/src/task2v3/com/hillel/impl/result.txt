Life is fine! Fine as wine! Life is fine!

If you gonna see me die.
I'll be dogged, sweet baby,
And you may see me cry--
Though you may hear me holler,

But for livin' I was born
I could've died for love--
I guess I will live on.
So since I'm still here livin',

But it was High up there! It was high!

I might've jumped and died.
If it hadn't a-been so high
I stood there and I cried!
I stood there and I hollered!

And thought I would jump down.
I thought about my baby
Sixteen floors above the ground.
I took the elevator

But it was Cold in that water! It was cold!

I might've sunk and died.
If that water hadn't a-been so cold
I came up twice and cried!
I came up once and hollered!

So I jumped in and sank.
I tried to think but couldn't,
I set down on the bank.
I went down to the river,
